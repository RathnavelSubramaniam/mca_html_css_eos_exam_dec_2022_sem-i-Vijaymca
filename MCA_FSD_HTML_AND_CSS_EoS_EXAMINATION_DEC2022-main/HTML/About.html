        <h1><b></b><i><u> Interior Design</u></i></b></h1>
        <p>Interior design is the art and science of understanding people's behavior to create functional <br>
        spaces,that are aesthetically pleasing,within a building. Decoration is the <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=interior++furniture+works+design+images&tbm=isch&ved=2ahUKEwil6u7074n8AhX7KbcAHaikDl0Q2-cCegQIABAA&oq=interior++furniture+works+design+images&gs_lcp=CgNpbWcQAzoECCMQJzoICAAQCBAHEB46BggAEAgQHlCQBlihQmCjTWgAcAB4AIABgQOIAZ4ekgEIMC4xLjE0LjGYAQCgAQGqAQtnd3Mtd2l6LWltZ8ABAQ&sclient=img&ei=mYuiY-W5EfvT3LUPqMm66AU&bih=586&biw=1231"><span> furnishing</a></span> or adorning<br>
        of a space with decorative elements,sometimes complemented by advice and practical assistance.<br>
        <h1><b></b><i><u> Interior designer</u></i></b></h1>
        Interior designer implies that there is more of an emphasis on planning,functional design and <br>
        the effective use of space, as compared to interior decorating. An interior designer in fine line<br>
        design can undertake projects that include arranging the basic layout of spaces within a building<br>
        as well as projects that require an understanding of technical issues such as window and door<br>
        positioning, acoustics, and lighting.Although an interior designer may create the layout of a space,<br>
        they may not alter load-bearing walls without having their designs stamped for approval by a structural<br>
        engineer. Interior designers often work directly with architects, engineers and contractors.</p>

        <p>The design team(s) responsible for the exterior of the vehicle develops the proportions, shape,<br>
        and surface details of the vehicle. Exterior design is first done by a series of manual sketches <br>
        and <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=digital+drawing+for+exterior+design&tbm=isch&ved=2ahUKEwjX4-v974n8AhXtk9gFHek5BQsQ2-cCegQIABAA&oq=digital+drawing+for+exterior+design&gs_lcp=CgNpbWcQAzoECCMQJzoHCCMQ6gIQJzoECAAQQzoICAAQgAQQsQM6CwgAEIAEELEDEIMBOgoIABCxAxCDARBDOgcIABCxAxBDOgUIABCABDoGCAAQBRAeOgYIABAIEB5Q9gVYtbABYMW0AWgDcAB4BIAB6AOIAfBfkgELMC40LjIzLjExLjWYAQCgAQGqAQtnd3Mtd2l6LWltZ7ABCsABAQ&sclient=img&ei=rIuiY9fdBu2n4t4P6fOUWA&bih=586&biw=1231"><span> digital </span></a>drawings. Progressively, drawings that are more detailed are executed and approved<br>
        by appropriate layers of management, followed by digital rendering to images. Consumer feedback is<br>
        generally sought at this point to help iteratively refine vehicle concepts according to the targeted <br>
        market and will continue throughout the rest of the design refinement process. After more progressive<br>
        refinement, industrial plasticine and or digital models are developed from and along with the drawings<br>
        and images. The data from these models are then used to create quarter-scale and finally full-sized <br>
        mock-ups of the final design. With three- and five-axis CNC milling machines, the clay model is first <br>
        designed in a computer program and then "carved" using the machine and large amounts of clay.<br>
        Even in times of photorealistic 3D (three dimensional) software and virtual models on power walls,<br>
        the clay model is still the most important tool for a final evaluation of the exterior design of a <br>
        vehicle and, therefore, is used throughout the industry.</p>
